#String Section Rostering Utility
## Software Development Plan

### Purpose

The utility of this application is two-fold. It is designed to:

1. Help manage specific musicians, including what instrument they play, and the specific roles that they perform.

2. Design rosters for specific concert programs, allowing both for manual and automatic filling of positions, whilst ensuring that players aren't put into inappropriate positions.
